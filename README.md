# fba_paper
A repository of code used in Shannon Kelley's paper "Age-related differences in white matter: Understanding tensor-based results using fixel-based analysis"

# Scripts showing how Fixel_based analysis was done are located in Whole Brain FBA
Run in order from run_mtrix 1 to run_mrtrix5
Also shows how PVE mask was created

#Examples of commands used for Tract Specific analysis are in the Tract Specific Analysis Folder
Subject's mean value is calculated in Tract_to_Values
FDC_stats shows how values for each subject for each tract are compiled
Permutation.m shows the script for permutation testing
Cohen.m shows how Cohen's D was found for a tract
Visualize shows how tracts were visualized for the figure

#FA controlled for CX has relevant scripts for this analysis

#Other MrTrix Commands contains a page of other commands used during analysis
How to get FA files, CX files, Visualization, whole brain VBA, etc.
